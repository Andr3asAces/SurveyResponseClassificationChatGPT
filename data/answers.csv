Approval,You've set out a roadmap with results to be published within a short timescale. I see this as a positive move.
Transparency,You will need to show that the actions promised have taken place. This will have to happen quickly as well to show you mean what you say or you will loose even more members. 
Leading by example,You are perceived to set the standard - it matters that everyone thinks you are getting it right after recent events.
Approval,You are in the spotlight so have to implement them. Many other large organisations probably have similar weaknesses but they aren't under such scrutiny.
More detail needed,Would like to see a 'vision' statement of the culture you want to achieve within the organisation - even if that is one that is open to input from members and your own people at this stage.      
Disappointment in previous processes,Wondering where monitoring was before it got to this point
More detail needed,"Whilst there are some positive moves for change, it is still a little unclear how things will be different. We know so little about what happened, it is difficult to know whether any of the people responsible are still there. "
Transparency,"Whilst the allegations need thorough investigation and sanctions, the wrongful actions of a small minority must not tarnish the hard work and dedication of the remaining staff. With this in mind, the culture change should be proportionate and not impose a myriad of processes and box ticking. Change is a leadership, not a bureaucratic matter."
Needs processes,What safeguards and reviews are going to be put in place to prevent re-occurrence or early detection of future issues?
Approval,We support the steps the CompanyX has and intends to take
Transparency,"We support the need for extensive review and considerations. Where possible, review findings and forward plans should be shared with members to ensure transparency and regain trust."
Leading by example,Walk the talk
Approval,Very welcomed
Approval,Very supportive of this. 
Approval,Very much welcomed.  Also worth noting that many other companies should be doing the same thing.
Transparency,"Transparency, pace and authenticity will be key. I personally think external steer and accountability will be key and a requirement for front loaded activity if you want to try and rebuild confidence. "
Disappointment in previous processes,This whole episode should not have happened
Other,"This is an extract from an email I sent to Brian McBride on 22 April ....    Ryder has been a member of the CompanyX for many years.  It is the membership organisation I regard most highly.  Having spoken to CompanyX people past and present about the situation, and the many events I’ve attended, the culture being reported in the media is not one that I recognise.    Two of your colleagues were due to attend and present to our year end conference on Monday.  I spent the majority of yesterday afternoon, and into the evening, defending our relationship with the CompanyX and my personal support for those people.  I’m disappointed at this decision to suspend all activity without consultation.  A decision which seems to have been taken in response to the announcements of large corporations rather than smaller businesses like Ryder.  It appears you are now the Confederation of BIG Industry.    .... You need to be sure who you're representing, I suspect the shareholder value incentivised businesses may have different views than owner managed SMEs."
Transparency,This is an ambitious programme and will take longer than a couple of months to implement. We will need regular updates on the rebuilding of CompanyX to develop confidence and trust in the organisation.
Leading by example,"This is a watershed moment for the CompanyX and agree that cultural renewal should be a priority. We hope that this process will provide a gold standard for other organisations to follow. However, the process cannot be 'do once and move on' as this needs to be change that is embedded for the long-term, so do not underestimate the ongoing work and investment required."
Approval,They have my full support
Approval,These look like sensible steps to take and I am supportive
Other,"There is a big difference between the processes and procedures to limit abuses of power and toxic individual managers vs. an organisation that needs cultural change as a whole. I have seen many CompanyX people shocked at the experiences others describe and that it does not match their experience of the organisation. This doesn't limit the impact of those individuals that have had shocking experiences, but it doesn't negate the good that the CompanyX does and the commitment and positive approach I have seen from the CompanyX teams I've engaged with"
New leadership,"There appears to be a gap in reviewing and considering corporate governance and structure. It is difficult to see how current structure and personnel present at the time overhaul culture. Moreover the challenges around purpose, remit and relevance are brought into sharp relief by the spotlight shone on culture but are not restricted to it"
Support for staff,The vital outcome is that there is an effective route for employees' concerns regarding bullying or sexual harassment  to be addressed in a manner which gives them confidence and no fear of impact on their career progression. At the same time it is important that any concerns are brought to the attention of the Board.
Transparency,The transparency of the findings are very important. 
Other,"The public updates from Brian have been excruciating to read - not just because of the hideousness of what they revealed or hinted at but because they went way beyond what was necessary or acceptable to share in public. It was as if the primary strategy was extreme self-flagellation as if that would bring some public understanding or restore confidence when, in fact it did the opposite. "
Transparency,The proposals seem necessary but not sufficient.  More focus is needed on the board that will support the executive in the transformation and in ensuring that this both challenges and supports appropriately the transformation. 
More detail needed,The proposal lacks any firm action points and is too broad and is at best a vague intention of action! No details about the 35 suggestions. Why?! 
Approval,The proposal for cultural renewal is sound given the  findings from the independent Fox Williams review.
More detail needed,"The plan sounds logical and sensible at high level but cultural change/renewal does not happen overnight. We will only be reassured when we see a detailed, milestone-based transformation plan that will take the CompanyX on the journey they need to go on  "
Leading by example,The people I know at the CompanyX are nice and have opened up opportunities for me. I was unaware of what had been going on and I do not want the organisation to disappear also do not believe that is only large organisations with a hidden unpleasant side so if a cultural renewal can cleanse the organisation of toxic behaviour it would also give hope to others working for and with other organisations that have not yet come to light.
CBI purpose,"The NFU supports the CompanyX's process for cultural renewal, which is crucial in the current circumstances to rebuild trust and support amongst staff, members, stakeholders, government and the wider public. It is important that the CompanyX manages the process in a way that complements its ""day job"" as it hopefully returns to operational normality in the months ahead, and doesn't detract from the task of rebuilding links with government and othe opinion formers, and ensuring it has the in-house expertise to develop robust and creative policy."
Transparency,"The key, as you have stated, is that there needs to be complete transparency. There will also need to be demonstrable action and a clear transformation from the previous CompanyX"
Other,"The focus of the CompanyX needs to be on actionable initiatives as opposed to the commissioning of large reports that end up being ""door stops"". A good example of this being the initiative that was launched to change the UK society's image of business. A better approach would have been to task each CompanyX member to launch small manageable initiatives in their own business, help them come up with the ideas for these small initiatives and then promote heavily the things businesses are doing to improve society."
More detail needed,"The current terms of reference for industrial membership has a clause that requires members to not bring CompanyX into disrepute. As part of culture renewal, the CompanyX needs to commit to the same language that it holds for its members.     I wish I knew how the CompanyX was going to demonstrate that it has a new culture - I’m expecting to see new documents that will define the future behaviour of individuals and culture of the organisation, but how are you going to demonstrate actual performance."
Transparency,"The credibility and validity of the EGM outcomes needs to be paramount.  The messaging needs to be very careful around not taking the blame or being seen to take the blame for the actions of certain individuals, and clear that the cultural issue is the environment that was created around those actions.  That needs to be clear, but the proposals for cultural renewal should not be the sole and primary area for the discussion that drowns out the 'repurpose"" piece and the value for money aspect of the organisation.  Cultural renewal should be iterative and ongoing, it should not be a lets get it done now and that's it, it needs to be clear it is an ongoing process."
New leadership,The challenge is belief that change will happen - the Board must step back at the point of transition to ensure new governance is in place. The mishandling of the past few months must be addressed.
Approval,"The CompanyX's span of influence is much greater than it's span of stakeholders, I do look to the CompanyX to address what needs to be addressed and proudly stand strong in coming years confidently in the knowledge that it's cultural practices are sound."
Approval,The CompanyX personnel I have met over the years are first class people both professionally and as good people.
Leading by example,"The CompanyX Needs to recognise the broad church of membership and allow those that share similar cultural values to be prioritised - not those that have the adverse public profile / external media issues. You need to be above this, and take decisive action to remove members that do NOT uphold your values. CompanyX needs to be better than the rest - not just average. "
Transparency,The CompanyX needs to deliver on cultural renewal and be seen to deliver it.  
Needs processes,"The CompanyX must institute robust, formal channels for whistleblowing and reporting."
Member inclusion,"The CompanyX has to reflect the business that it represents, and not the political parties it seeks to influence. In my opinion, the organisation has behaved politically, an less commercially.   Almost in a subservient way to the government, rather than an agitator to the government, to improve the policies to make the UK more competitive.Where was the CompanyX's voice in the Brexit debate for instance?"
Approval,The CompanyX has no option but to address the failings in its culture. Values are critical and culture will always flow from the the top leadership and governing Board. 
Trust,"The CompanyX has consistently told us that it has lost the trust of its members. This is overstating the position. The CompanyX has lost some members through 'loss of trust' and some because it suited them to resign to join other lobbying organisations and some because they used the moment to underline their D&I credentials......but it did not lose the trust of many of its members, particularly those that knew it well. So using the phrase 'regain lost trust' actually embeds a greater anxiety about 'what the CompanyX is actually like' than many members had.  I am therefore somewhat sceptical about the scope of the canvas of 'cultural renewal'. Did the CompanyX need cultural renewal or did it need a clearer head in dealing with occasional and rare episodes of exceptionally bad behaviour?"
Concern over future,The CompanyX brand and reputation appears to have suffered irreversible damage. The more recent allegations about the Tesco CE and the links to his time as CompanyX President are further evidence of this. It is really unclear whether the CompanyX (despite all the fantastic work it does) can come back from this. 
Concern over future,"That sounds like a robust response. My only fear is that perception is reality and whether the government and wider business community have lost confidence in the CompanyX to represent business through what they perceive has happened whether or not these are proven.  As an employee owned trust, set up as an ethical business that is purpose-driven and values-led, we have had clients querying our ongoing relationship with the CompanyX."
Speed,Speed is of the essence.
Approval,Sounds sensible to me.  Need to demonstrate visible commitment to a new future
More detail needed,Sounds like the right approach but difficult to comment without link to full recommendations.
Approval,Should be done
Approval,"Sensible approach however the CompanyX do not need to ""over react or be over zealous"""
Approval,"Seems sensible, but no need to go too far"
More detail needed,"Seems reasonable, sumarised as: set up a committee to look at culture, new CPO position, independent complaints channel. How much these will cost is another issue presumably and the 'independent' channel is only as good as its influence on/standing in the organisation. "
Approval,Seems appropriate
Approval,Seems an excellent initiative in the light of recent events and allegations. 
Approval,Seems a sensible way forward on the assumption that the CompanyX has a future as a membership/lobbying body
Needs processes,"Please don't throw the baby out with the bathwater in making change.  The CompanyX has been an incredible force for good, e.g. during Covid, the CompanyX helped thousands of businesses successfully navigate dangerous unchartered waters.  Indirectly therefore, the CompanyX helped millions of families benefit from continued employment and job security at a time of fear and peril.   Whilst actions to modernise, improve whistle blowing, improve corporate culture are important given the situation faced, please retain the benefits that the CompanyX offers to its membership.  Do not fall on your sword where you do not need to as this may set a precedent for business to be seen as ""guilty by media until proven innocent."" "
Other,Overall all organisations should seek constant improvement
Outside input,"Outside input is valuable for a process like this. Ultimately it has to be led and managed internally, in a consistent and evolving way, to get the long-term traction that any change in culture requires. "
Approval,Only that this is clearly essential 
Speed,"Of course, it's extremely important to address the culture and the governance around the organisation we can't afford to take too long to do. This otherwise will lose more members. I'm extremely supportive of the CompanyX and have been for many years and I think that it's critical that we are successful. "
Approval,Nothing specific. I think the CompanyX have dealt with an extremely  difficult situation well. 
Outside input,Nothing specific.  It is a good idea to appoint third party advisers.  
Other,Not sure what else you can do
Approval,"Not really, there has obviously been an issue in the past - I have only known the CompanyX teams ince 2020 and I will be honest and say i have never witnessed or heard about any issues. "
More detail needed,"Not at this stage, but we await the detail with interest."
Approval,Nope all looks good.
More detail needed,"No. Not at this stage, I'm interested in the timescales for this work and whethee you'll publish any interim reports"
Needs processes,"no, I don't even know enough about the CompanyX to think it needs a ''cultural renewal''. Do you? the behaviour of a few is not representative of your culture. But you do need a very effective way of ''catching'' poor behaviour. I suggest a whistle blower arrangement run by an external company."
More detail needed,No mention of review of governance 
Transparency,No - you just need to implement the changes quickly and transparently. 
Approval,No - needs to happen.
Other,Move on from using external advisors as soon as possible and make sure your leadership team own the change
Approval,Lose the bad eggs and move on. 'cultural reviews' etc cost lots of money. The people I work with in the CompanyX have had great professionalism and integrity and I personally have not witnessed any of the actions that have been suggested.
Support for staff,"Looks thorough to me. It seems to me that the emphasis should be on high levels of management capability re people management rather than focus in beefing up HR too much. HR set the strategy, managers implement and are accountable for their own people.  "
Approval,Looks like it is needed urgently
Disappointment in previous processes,Its very disappointing that in todays business environment and a subscription organisation has not been proactive in areas of culture and diversity 
Transparency,"It's right that the CompanyX now engages in a transparent, public and most importantly, action-oriented reform of its governance in order to regain public trust."
Approval,it's clearly needed and an appropriate process appears to have been instigated
More detail needed,Its clear that the culture has been wrong for an extended period and was deeply imbedded with wholly shocking behaviour not just happening but also not being addressed when it was found to happen. The renewal is essential but the scale of transformation required may be much greater than the organisation estimates.
Approval,It's a lot too implement. Content looks good
CBI purpose,"It’s the correct response, but important not to lose sight of the essential question as to - what is the value of the CompanyX? Unless CompanyX can address that then the cultural review becomes academic.  So while this may have been triggered by issues linked to culture, the CompanyX are facing a far deeper existential crisis.  Focussing on culture alone will not persuade the doubters."
Approval,It’s good the recommendations are being acted on. 
Speed,It will take many years. 
Transparency,It will be important to provide updates at regular intervals e.g. every 3 months on what has been achieved to build back trust and transparency.
Support for staff,"It will be critical that the CompanyX is able to co-develop its workforce culture with its membership and representative style culture.  Whilst it seems that, internally, there is the need to develop a culture of high professional standards and perhaps of nurture so employees feel they can raise concerns.  The external culture must continue to have the capability to be strident and forthright on issues which matter to members.    Do not allow this exercise to confuse the internal leadership and management of the CompanyX's culture with the requirements of the CompanyX as the leading voice of business.    "
New leadership,It still feels like current or ex employees are leading the change - whilst i have high regard for those individuals I believe that is entirely wrong and not credible from a societal and business perception
Concerns over effectiveness,"It sounds formulaic and scripted, and it seems rushed (as has been the case with a large amount of what has happened in recent months).  I would have reservations about the potential efficacy - if the historic issues are present today a clear out is required, not a culture building programme.  If the issues are indeed historic, then this feels like a PR stunt more than a productive exercise.  My hope is this is not simply doing something to be seen to be doing something."
Approval,It seems appropriate - clearly a cultural overhaul is needed. 
New leadership,it needs to be fundamental and must include reforming governance including the main board and especially the operating board
Transparency,It needs to be completely open and transparent  - the secretive nature and closing down conversations has been one of the problems - NO MORE CHATHAM HOUSE RULES - if you can say it/do it openly then best not to do it. 
Approval,It is welcomed.
Approval,It is obviously a positive way forward after the allegations.
Approval,"It is needed because of the media storm around the organisation. Quite what the truth, if any, of the allegations are, I’m afraid, irrelevant in C21st Britain."
Outside input,It is good that you are adopting all the recommendations and engaging Principia. It requires both cultural change and processes that ensure transparency and safety.
Transparency,"It is essential, must be thorough and inclusive of all views. No stone left unturned ... external evaluation and critique"
Concern over future,It is essential if the organisation is to survive
Speed,"It is critical to the survival of the CompanyX that this renewal is completed quickly. Business needs to be represented to government, but the CompanyX is not in a position to do this at the moment."
Member inclusion,It is critical to re-engender member organisations
Approval,It is clearly needed as is an understanding as to why allegations or concerns were not raised or escalated.
Approval,It is a healthy strategy to periodically review an organisation's culture and engaging with its staff is a key element of this. Inviting anonymous feedback tends to draw out honest feedback.
Other,It has to come from within.
Leading by example,"It feels very 'left brain', eg legalistic, strategic, policed, rigid, stick rather than carrot, masculine.  Where is the discussion about leaders setting an example through their own behaviour, eg kindness, thoughtful, caring, intuitive, creative, feminine, emotional, feeling.  There is a huge opportunity to become much more balanced and heart based.  There is too much emphasis on 'strategic', yes this is important but so is moving forwards into a kinder more balanced environment.  There is so much fear at the moment and people want a balanced life not a work life balance.  The CompanyX has an opportunity to be much more holistic and set the standard for business in the 21st century."
Approval,It clearly is necessary
CBI purpose,"It appears focused on HR governance, specifically reporting of concerns, whereas the recent allegations are indicative of a wider cultural problem.  You should address the full values of the leadership, starting with your organisation's purpose.  Ethics are far more than the way individuals treat staff, it's about how all your decisions are made to focus on fairness, transparency and equality.  Business these days has a fundamental responsibility to society and the CompanyX should be addressing that far more explicitly in all you do and role modelling modern business. "
More detail needed,"It all sounds good: but we are all watching for concrete, tangible changes "
More detail needed,In order for CompanyX to regain its standing credibility and therefore influence it is imperative that any review is comprehensive and that CompanyX is able to convince some businesses that have recently ended their membership to return.
Support for staff,Important to ensure that CompanyX employees in their 20s and 30s have equal voice to those who are 40+
More detail needed,Important to differentiate where possible between London and regions in terms of culture 
Leading by example,"If correctly communicated it could be an opportunity to demonstrate that best practice with no stone unturned has been carried out and now there are the utmost foundations for growth. Almost like admitting that in a few areas CompanyX must have been unconsciously incompetent ( as things occurred) , now you have moved through the consciously incompetent stage to set firm structure for consciously competent and ultimately running a culture and organisation whereby  the mechanisms and people are unconsciously competent. "
CBI purpose,"I would not like to offer advice in such a delicate situation.    However, you need to get back to business soon with a clean slate and back to business.  You need some easy wins."
Approval,I wish CompanyX every success in tackling a major challenge- the damage to the brand and the organisation is profound quite apart from the personal trauma on the individuals involved.
Approval,"I welcome the proposed cultural renewal, and look forward to hearing more details shortly. "
Disappointment in previous processes,"I welcome the changes, but, do feel that the CompanyX may have overreacted here. Some of the reports of issues are horrendous, disgusting, and inexcusable - and to have members of staff who helped cover them up, is unacceptable. But, in an organisation of 100s of employees and 1,000s of members, with a nearly 60 year history, to have a just handful of issues over its existence is better than most similar organisations could claim - and I genuinely feel that most of the current issues are of the CompanyXs making in the way it has responded to this - so we'd like to see improvements in the CompanyX's handling of issues in future"
Disappointment in previous processes,I was surprised to learn that there was no governance paid to safety/ belonging/ welfare within the ExCo and Board regular review. This is clearly long overdue. 
Disappointment in previous processes,"I was surprised to hear that wasn't any HR at top board level and so think ensuring that HR and cultural change is crucial, so that people feel safe to raise concerns,."
Disappointment in previous processes,"I want to look forwards and I agree that the proposals look sound. However, given the role the CompanyX plays and the parties with which it interacts, with trust as the foundation for all our work, there is a legitimate question as to why the culture was not previously fit for purpose. I have a concern that it will be tough to rebuild trust, so implementing recommendations and changes, asking they why etc will be critical, but has the CompanyX brand been dealt a fatal blow despite all the great work that is set to be undertaken. "
Transparency,I think the public statements and independent reviews are key to move this forward if the CompanyX is to be demonstrate change. I do feel the CompanyX would have had knowledge of this and it should not have taken such public statements to then manage the situation. It feels that this is only being address due to it being public. 
Approval,I think the culture I've seen has been great 
Approval,I think that the proposal is sound.  I would not wish to see the CompanyX changing its general remit or focus in response to the allegations.  I regard the CompanyX is a powerful and constructive voice.
Other,I think members should be given a pro-rata refund whilst you've been undertaking this process as there hasn't been much external activity to speak of. 
Leading by example,I think it’s commendable and clearly some things need to change. The events that led to this are horrific but I think many of your members will be looking at themselves and realise that they have similar deficiencies. We’re all learning on your watch.    Second thing is I work closely with the NI team who are female-led and have been brilliant throughout my membership.
Member inclusion,I think it needs to also take into account the older cohort of independent business owners and managers in future. Not just the younger up and coming or large businesses.
Approval,"I think it is the right approach to implement the 35 specific recommendations and, as a separate project, carry out the culture review to look at the bigger picture."
Approval,I think CompanyX is taking the right action
Other,"I think alongside that you have to create a role and a North Star, without that you will have a worthy organisation with no sense of purpose."
Approval,I support the recommendations.
Approval,I have every confidence that the CompanyX will put the necessary in place to prevent a repeat of the recent allegations.
Disappointment in previous processes,I have been astonished by the apparent lack of systems in place to prevent this organisational melt down. I am struggling to understand how an external consultancy firm can identify 35 areas for improvement in an organisation that is so well established and delivers leadership development services.
Approval,I feel all the right things are being said and new appointment has been made to show to members real tangible steps. This will need to continue with the plan
Outside input,"I can understand the use of an expert group such as Principia Advisory.  It will be important to achieve a balance between the use of independent experts and the impression that the job has been outsourced because we don't have the capability to do it ourselves.  Principia need to move quickly into the background to demonstrate that the CompanyX owns the process, findings and implementation."
Transparency,I believe that this is the key to growing trust in the CompanyX as a responsible employer and organisation to the members and broader community. It is very important that decisions are fully explained to the membership and broader community to ensure that well intentioned actions are fully understood to build trust again in the organisation. e.g. the external optic of bringing in Rain to oversee the change when she was a senior part of the organisation when many of these issues arose.
More detail needed,I believe that there will need to be some bold and swift actions (not intentions) to show the Government and businesses that the organisation has changed.
Disappointment in previous processes,I am surprised that manner of the issues raised are not already in place and concerns over the need to appoint new roles to have to manage what should be common place business risks that all organisations face and address on a everyday basis.    
Support for staff,"I am sure there is a lot of work and thinking that is going on behind the scenes but it is not visible from this place.     I cannot see the “how” of how you will embed the recommendations. Saying you will change, saying you will empower people to come forward is very different from them feeling empowered.     A lot of emphasis is being placed on the EGM. That is not a deadline for “job done”.  There is a very long road ahead and I’d expect different times to be made available where CompanyX visibly evaluate their progress post EGM. "
More detail needed,"I am supportive of the necessity for a culture renewal and it is important that the outcomes of that process are and are seen to be addressing the findings of the independent reports and also (to the extent they differ) the concerns of broader stakeholders raised in the media. However, it is hard to comment without seeing any detail on the actual proposal beyond the Fox Williams' recommendations."
Concern over future,I am supportive of the action you are taking but do worry that the damage is too great making it really difficult for me to imagine that you will ever rebuild the level of trust that you had with businesses and the Government
Outside input,"I am pleased to see that you have hired experts in this field to provide guidance and are committed to implementing their advice. Also very supportive of the process of learning from your own employees experiences, listening to their stories and utilizing that core data to create a path to developing a new culture - both in terms of what was working well as well as being clear about what needs to change. "
More detail needed,I am not really aware of what it is other than a vague aspiration and a potential name change. The name change should be carefully considered as the CompanyX is a long-standing brand which might be easier to revive and replace.
Needs processes,"I am not necessarily convinced it is a cultural issue per se. However, the fact that people didn't feel they had the opportunity to raise any concerns means that there is a failure in processes and policies that would make it clear that such incidents would be dealt with with the utmost professionalism. "
Other,"I am concerned that the remit of the Chief People Officer in the Fox Williams report describes an enforcer in what appears to be a totalitarian system. My observation is that a healthy culture is led by a servant leadership philosophy where power is shared, employees needs are prioritised and individuals are encouraged to develop and perform as highly as possible. The four enablers of Employee Engagement as described by McLeod and Clarke in the 'Engaging for Success Report' are most effective; Strong Narrative, Engaging Managers, Employee Voice and Organisational Integrity. As the famous Management Consultant Peter Drucker is frequently quoted, 'Culture eats strategy for breakfast' the CompanyX would be wise to focus on their culture."
Approval,I agree with it.  The CompanyX must focus on its people and ensure there is a culture which reflects society as a whole.
Leading by example,"I agree wholeheartedly with the proposal for cultural renewal. If implemented successfully, CompanyX's cultural transformation could act as an exemplar to improve UK business culture as a whole. "
Disappointment in previous processes,"How will you change mindsets and habits acquired over many years, which will have been reinforced by the various layers of management?"
Support for staff,"How will the CompanyX ensure that all its staff are open to the process? It has become clear that many CompanyX staffers were unaware of the issues and there has been a defensive response in some quarters, which can pose challenges to efforts at cultural renewal."
Support for staff,"Hopefully the employees feel free to express themselves, this could be difficult for them if they want to try to remain positive for the company image - this is not a reflection on the CompanyX, just how humans may feel in the same scenario at any company"
More detail needed,Having read the 35 point they all feel very process and policy related. I haven't gone through them with a fine tooth comb but the overriding message that 'treating people with dignity & respect will be a fundamental part of the behaviours we expect and will be a common thread through everything we do' feels likes its missing. 
Outside input,Great to see a 3rd party being brought in to recommend changes required.  Members need to experience the changes being implemented in our interactions to trust that this is more than a PR exercise.
Needs processes,"Governance measures, reporting access options along with swift and appropriate supporting actions will be key."
Approval,Good luck.  We would like to continue to support you and have you to support us.
Approval,Good approach
Outside input,"Given the seriousness of the situation, getting expert, independent legal and ethics counsel to review the situation and recommend changes seems to be an appropriate course of action. "
More detail needed,"Given the scale of the allegations and institutional failure on the part of the CompanyX, the proposals make sense at this stage. It is important that further information and guidance is given on how the CompanyX proposes to implement the recommendations. "
More detail needed,Given the allegations and the press coverage there is a clear need to understand the root causes and to address them so that the CompanyX can provide leadership for UK Business and Industry.
Other,Get rid of your excessive “woke” approach
Transparency,"From my perspective, this is not that interesting to members.  I have only looked at the Fox Williams' recommendations briefly, but I would have thought that it is the responsibility of senior management to act on the legal advice.  Absolutely, do a thorough review and take legal advice and, subsequently, communicate how things have been addressed and, when they are, that they are totally fit for purpose."
Approval,"From all that I have heard and seen, the CompanyX appears to be doing the right things."
Other,Far too long.  
Approval,Essential to revive the CompanyX reputation. I welcome the initiative.
Leading by example,Essential to its future especially as the organisation has been so vocal to its members about its members leading on EDI and levelling up - social mobility 
CBI purpose,Don't thro the baby out with the bathwater  Many of us spent a year or more on launching the CompanyX initiative to improve employee health and well being both mental and physical. It was to have been the priority CompanyX initiative for this year. The potential loss of this will have far more significant ramifications to employees across the UK than CompanyXs own current problem.
Leading by example,"Difficult to have much to add - from the outside, in my experience, there was not any perceivable problem with culture at the CompanyX, so the situation you face has me, at least, thinking ""what could be lurking within my own organisations (where I currently think it's ""fine""). Clearly there have been some rotten areas within the CompanyX and as such I support your desire to root that out, whether you need a big expensive project with consultants I can't judge, might be more about PR than actually necessary, but then again, I don't work within the CompanyX so perhaps you're right..... Sorry for my rambling reflections!"
Support for staff,"Defining the cultural identity and then moving towards it should involve staff, the board and members"
Needs processes,"Culture renewal is extremely complex and time consuming. The proposal to try and change the culture seem appropriate, but given that the measures are process focused (inevitably) but the crucial test is whether those processes deliver outcomes, it is difficult to be confident of their success."
Member inclusion,Culture needs to extend to volunteers and members as well. This means that there needs to be a common understanding of both the expectations and sanctions put inplace for all CompanyX locations and events
Needs processes,"Culture is enormously important, but needs to be supported by the governance structures and processes of the organisation. These should also be reviewed to assure their effectiveness. "
Concern over future,"Culture is a part of brand.  Sadly the Brand has been tarnished by the behaviors of a few, including senior individuals.  Cultural renewal by itself is therefore unlikely to be sufficient.  "
Support for staff,Culture comes from the top.  It has to be supported by openness and a willingness to make and hear positive criticism/comments
More detail needed,Culture change will require clear and inspiring leadership and organisational buy-in. Take your team with you. 
New leadership,Cultural review starts with the people and significant change.  I am amazed the entire Board and officers have not resigned.
Disappointment in previous processes,"Cultural renewal is very important.  I am disappointed that the CompanyX clearly is/was no different to a large number of organisations who have great words about behaviours and culture but in reality the accepted day to day actions are/were completely different.   I am especially disappointed with the CompanyX, as the CompanyX had a tendency to lecture member firms on how they should behave and treat their staff members. The arrogance and the ""Do as I say, not as I do"" attitude, "
Transparency,"Critical to the future viability of the CompanyX, transparency key with members and the wider business and Government communities."
Speed,Crack on with it - the sooner the trust is re-built the better. We value the work CompanyX did.
Transparency,"Commit to complete transparency at every step and also find a time - hard to tell when - when you move from humility and apology to determination and confidence. until then, it'll be open season for anyone to jump on the situation and air their personal views on the CompanyX, often without substance. At some point that needs to be challenged - and advocates can help with that where it is hard for the CompanyX to do itself."
CBI purpose,Comments provided are my personal ones based on many years of interaction with CompanyX. AZ will provide consolidated input to CompanyX on future focus and participate in the EGM.   I believe the core activities of the CompanyX remain essential for many businesses - often these are unseen in companies and are not addressed by sectoral trade bodies. Accordingly it is vital that CompanyX addresses the cultural challenges and presents a strong and action orientated plan to Members that regains the trust and support of staff and external stakeholder's confidence in the organisation's integrity and purpose. 
Approval,Clearly needed from recent events and reports.  Good luck with it.
Approval,"Changing culture is a hard road, and important not to lose the good bits of the culture - but ultimately, it is all about people and having the right people in the business."
Outside input,CompanyX seem to be taking all the right steps and engaging independent partners both on the review conducted and the plan for change is reassuring.
Approval,CompanyX appear to be taking the situation they find themselves in seriously
Approval,Broadly supported.
More detail needed,Big undertaking and needed; should build also on member/sister associations’ advice/ and benchmarking on how to manage ‘culture’ in a membership organisation (not just corporate members); define with your staff your purpose and values; mission as one team; 
Leading by example,Be clear about expectations and standards of behaviour especially when representing the company and in interactions with business. 
More detail needed,"Be careful that you make ""developing culture"" a box ticking exercise. It needs to be genuine. "
Leading by example,"As well as being the voice for UK business, the CompanyX should now become a beacon for best practice in HR, Culture and Governance and actively help members on replicating these in our businesses. "
Approval,appropriate response
Approval,Apparently much needed
Approval,appalled that it should be necessary but supportive of the general direction of travel
Disappointment in previous processes,Am so disappointed that the cultural issues are so very bad as to need 35 recommendations and a complete root and branch review of culture. How can it have got so bad?
Approval,All the right steps being taken.
Approval,All seem to address the issues.
Needs processes,"All organisations need to be aware of their own culture and in our business we seek annually to question and explore any issues and seek improvements.  Statements and objectives are all fine, but need leadership from the top down and with good management and communication comes improved culture"
Approval,All of the above is very encouraging.  
Approval,All appears positive and sensible
Approval,Agree with the approach you are taking.
Approval,Agree with approach and proposal
More detail needed,Actions will be the acid test for future credibility
Approval,Absolutely essential for the future credibility and viability of CompanyX
Approval,A wise step given the furore surrounding recent events.
Approval,A start of a journey
Outside input,"A sensible approach to getting 'best in class' advise, especially when acting as representative for a wide range of businesses"
Approval,A review of the culture and purpose of the organisation is welcome. 
New leadership,A complete rebuild and overhaul of the organisation is required. 
More detail needed,35 need to be boiled down - quality over quantity 
More detail needed,"• The ABPI considers that full implementation of the recommendations of the Fox William report is crucial to the CompanyX being able to move forward.  • For the ABPI to feel confident about our own and our members’ staff engaging with the CompanyX in future, we would want to be sure that suitable, effective routes exist for all stakeholders (whether CompanyX employees or not) to raise concerns relating to culture or behaviour, either named or anonymously.  • The current focus on cultural renewal gives the CompanyX the opportunity to build a culture that demonstrates best-in-class governance, but this can only happen if it is committed to a thorough, top to bottom, overhaul of practices, behaviour and processes. As a representative of British industry, the CompanyX must aim high. We would like to see much more detail about how they propose to do this. Specifically:  o While the CompanyX appears to have had appropriate HR and governance policies in place, these have evidently not been adhered to and must in future be enforced, with employee advocacy having a voice and weight at the most senior levels of the organisation to ensure this happens.  o The CompanyX must demonstrate clearly how its Board is assessing and monitoring culture, and how it ensures that management is taking corrective action as and when required. We require evidence of steps being put in place for employees and other stakeholder groups to raise their views confidently and regularly with the Board and senior management.   o An independent director should be tasked with overseeing culture and employee engagement, meeting regularly with employee groups and providing regular reports to the Board. This is in addition to the Chief People Officer role.  "
